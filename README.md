# Triangle

A dashboard-style Next.js application that:

- Lets users enter locations via Google Places Autocomplete
- Organizes entries into two lists:
  - **Addresses** (red pins)
  - **Potential Centrals** (blue pins)
- Calculates and displays:
  - The **geographic center** of all addresses (yellow pin)
  - The **most central** potential location (green pin)
- Allows moving or removing items between lists
- Automatically adjusts the mapâ€™s view so all markers remain visible
